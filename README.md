# Dioptase-Pipe-Simple

Pipeline implementation of [Dioptase-Emulator-Simple](https://github.com/b-Rocks2718/Dioptase-Emulator-Simple)

6 stage pipeline

- fetch a
- fetch b
- decode
- execute
- mem
- writeback

Memory stage path length limited JPEB to 50Mhz, running Dioptase at 100MHz would be nice

## Usage

Use `make sim.vvp` to build the project.
Run it on a hex file with `./sim.vvp +hex=<file.hex>`

Run the tests with `make all`.

The test suite consists of all tests used for verifying the emulator, in addition pipeline-specific tests to ensure forwarding, stalls, and misaligned memory accesses are handled correctly.
